# Introduction

In this chapter we focus on *classfication*. This includes *logistic regression*, *linear discriminant analysis*, *quadratic discriminant analysis*, *naive Bayes* and *K-nearest neighbors*.

All the same things can also be learned by following the following [Statquest playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8&list=PLblh5JKOoLUKxzEP5HA2d-Li7IJkHfXSe).

# Data
In this chapter we will try to predict if a person will default or not based on income and account balance (see figure).

# Why not Linear Regression?
Unfortunately the coding of output variable would imply an ordering on the outcomes, which would mess up the model. Even for two classes a model would not output probabilities, but it would also output values outside the interval [0:1].

# 1. Logistic Regression
Instead of fitting a line to the data, a *logistic regression* fits an S-shaped logistic function with the max and minimum values 1 and 0. Despite the function having a different shape, *logistic regression* is still considered a linear model. A *logistic regression*, for a binary outcome, calculates the probability for one of the outcomes $p(default)$, and has the formula:

$p(X) = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}$

This model is fit using *maximum likelihood*, which is basically fitting a bunch of S-shaped lines and calculating their probabilities given the data. The line with *maximum likelihood* is then picked.

In logistic regression the y-axis is transformed from *probability* to *log(odds)*, such that its y-axis can go from -infinity to +infinity, just like that of linear regression.

The translation between *probability* and *log odds* can see for a sample in the table inderneath.

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Log Odds translations
translation_table = data.frame(
  "Propability" = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), 
  "Odds" = seq(1,9)/seq(9,1),
  "Log Odds" = log(seq(1,9)/seq(9,1)))
knitr::kable(translation_table, "pipe")
```

# 1.1 Coefficients

The coefficients you get when doing logistic regression are for a linear line in a coordinate system where the y-axis is measured in *log(odds)*. You get the following statistics:

Intercept: Self-explanatory
Slope: Self-explanatory
Standard Error: How much one expects the value to vary from the real value
Z-value: The estimated coefficient divided by the standard error, thus the number of standard deviations the coefficient is away from zero.

Unlike linear regression, we can't easily compare the complicated model to the simple model e.g.: 

**Obesity** predicted by **Weight + Genotype**  
vs  
**Obesity** predicted by **Weight + Genotype + Age**

# X. Chapter Exercises & Answers
As most exercises are redundant for my brush up on statistical methods, I will only be solving select exercises. Great answers by Liam Morgan to all of the exercises can be found at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/lmorgan95/ISLR_CH4_Solutions).

# X.1 Logistic Regression

Here we download the **Heart Disease Dataset** to classify if a person is healthy or unhealthy.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)

# Downloading data
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data"
data <- read.csv(url, header=FALSE)

# Adding column names
colnames(data) <- c("age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restcg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "hd") 

# Fixing column types
data[data == "?"] <- NA
data$sex <- ifelse(data$sex == 0, "F", "M")
data$ca <- as.integer(data$ca)
data$thal <- as.integer(data$thal)
data$hd <- ifelse(data$hd == 0, "Healthy", "Unhealthy")
factor_columns <- c("sex","cp", "fbs", "restcg", "exang", "slope", "ca", "thal", "hd")
data[factor_columns] <- lapply(data[factor_columns], factor)

# Removing samples with missing data
data <- data[!(is.na(data$ca) | is.na(data$thal)),]
```

Now we will make increasingly more complex models predicting health

```{r}
# Making a logistic regression model
model <- glm(hd ~ sex, data=data, family = "binomial")
summary(model)
```

The output equations is:

$hearth\ disease=-1.0438+IsMale*1.2737$

The output value of the equation is the *log odds* that a person has a heart disease. Translation between probability, odds and log odds are best explained in this table.

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Log Odds translations
translation_table = data.frame(
  "Propability" = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), 
  "Odds" = seq(1,9)/seq(9,1),
  "Log Odds" = log(seq(1,9)/seq(9,1)))
knitr::kable(translation_table, "pipe")
```

So the results are interpreted as if your *log odds* for heart disease will increase by 1.2737 if you are a male. The *standard error* and *z-value* are for calculating the *Wald's test*, while the p-value states its significance. 

Now it is time for a mode fancy models with all the variables.

```{r}
# Making a logistic regression model
model <- glm(hd ~ ., data=data, family = "binomial")
summary(model)
```
```{r}
# Calculating McFadden's Pseudo R^2
ll.null <- model$null.deviance/-2
ll.proposed <- model$deviance/-2
(ll.null-ll.proposed)/ll.null

# Calculating p-value using a chi-squared distribution
1 - pchisq(2*(ll.proposed - ll.null), df=(length(model$coefficients)-1))
```
The $McFaddan\ Pseudo\ R^2$ can be interpreted as the overall effect size, and its p-value is significant as it if very close to zero. Now let's draw a graph with the predictions.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.asp = .62,  fig.align = "center"}
# Making predictions
predicted.data <- data.frame(
  probability.of.hd=model$fitted.values,
  hd=data$hd
)

# Ordering data
predicted.data <- predicted.data[order(predicted.data$probability.of.hd, decreasing = F),]

# Adding index
predicted.data$index <- seq(1, nrow(predicted.data))

# Plotting data
ggplot(predicted.data, aes(index, probability.of.hd, color=hd)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Predicted probability of\ngetting heart disease") +
  labs(color='Heart Status') +
  theme_bw()
```



```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.asp = .62,  fig.align = "center"}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
```
